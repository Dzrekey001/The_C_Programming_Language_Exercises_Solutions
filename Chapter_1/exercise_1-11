Question: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?


To test the word count program, you can provide various types of input to ensure that the program counts lines, words, and characters correctly.

Empty Input:
Test the program with no input or just pressing Enter. The program should display 0 lines, 0 words, and 0 characters.

Single Word Input:
Input a single word followed by Enter. The program should display 1 line, 1 word, and the number of characters in the word.

Multiple Words on a Single Line:
Input several words separated by spaces on a single line. The program should count the words and characters correctly.

Multiple Lines:
Input multiple lines with various combinations of words and spaces. Make sure to include empty lines and lines with only spaces. The program should correctly count lines, words, and characters.

Tab and Newline Characters:
Include tabs and newline characters in the input. The program should correctly handle these characters and count them as characters and words.

Consecutive Spaces:
Input multiple spaces between words. The program should count these as a single word and ignore the extra spaces.

Leading and Trailing Spaces:
Input lines with leading and trailing spaces. The program should correctly count words and characters while ignoring leading and trailing spaces.

Mixed Characters:
Input a combination of letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. The program should correctly count words and characters while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

Special Cases:
Test edge cases such as very long lines, very large inputs, and input containing special characters or non-ASCII characters.
